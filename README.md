# 🍕 Pizza Sales Insights Dashboard

In this project, I analyzed a year’s worth of pizza sales data using SQL and Power BI to uncover patterns in customer behavior, seasonal trends, and product performance. I designed SQL queries for data extraction, cleaning, and aggregation, then developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that transformed raw transactional data into actionable business insights.

## 📅 Understanding Customer Behavior by Day

The analysis revealed that Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturday evenings are the busiest periods for orders. This weekend surge suggests that customers tend to indulge more toward the end of the week, possibly due to social gatherings, leisure time, and a general “weekend treat” mindset. This insight can help the business allocate more staff and optimize promotions during peak hours.

## 📆 Monthly Sales Trends

Monthly data showed that January, May, and July recorded the highest number of orders. These months likely align with festive seasons and holiday periods when group dining and celebrations are common. Businesses can use this trend to plan marketing campaigns and stock management ahead of high-demand months.

## 🍕 Product Category & Size Performance

Among all categories, the Classic pizzas stood out — driving the highest sales and total orders. Customers’ preference for traditional flavors emphasizes the importance of consistency and quality in the core menu.

When it comes to size, the Large pizzas brought in the highest sales revenue, proving that customers are willing to spend more for value and shareable portions.


## Diving deeper into product performance:

1. Spicy Italian Pizza generated the highest total revenue, positioning it as the most profitable menu item.

2. Prosciutto & Arugula Pizza achieved the highest quantity sold, reflecting its broad popularity among customers.

3. Pepper Salami Pizza received the most orders overall, showing strong demand across customer segments.

4.Interestingly, the Brie Carre Pizza consistently demonstrated strong performance, ranking as the top product among the lower five yet contributing significantly to overall revenue, quantity sold, and total orders—making it a notable standout across all key performance indicators.
